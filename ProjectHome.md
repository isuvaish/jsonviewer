This is a simple Adobe AIR application used for inspecting JSON data. Like a lot of folks, I use JSON a lot for data transfer on AJAX applications and for Flash development. I often find myself using Firebug to watch the data being sent/received. JSON has a lot of advantages over XML, but it can be hard to view. There are many great tools for pretty-printing XML or giving a graphical representation of it, but not too many for JSON. So I wrote my own. It makes use of the Adobe corelib for doing the JSON parsing.
